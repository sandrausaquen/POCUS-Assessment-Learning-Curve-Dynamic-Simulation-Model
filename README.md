The accelerated pace with which new diagnostic possibilities are produced and the budget restrictions of the healthcare sector require that the decision-making process of acquiring new technologies becomes systematic. Some methodologies, such as the Health Technology Assessment (HTA), encompass technological domains, clinical effectiveness, patient safety, and organizational and financial aspects. However, these methods do not contemplate the learning curve (LC), a differential factor in operator- dependent technologies. An assessment model was conceived based on the assessment domains of the AdHopHTA project with the addition of LC. The model was validated and calibrated through System Dynamics (SD) and used as a case study to assess Point-of-care Ultrasound (POCUS) equipment in dengue screening. The model helped identify the influence of the LC and patient demand on the income and costs of the healthcare system regarding dengue screening and the cost-benefit indicator. This work highlights the development of HTA models under a systemic approach and the importance of research on the impact of LC in decision-making for medical equipment acquisition. It is expected to keep exploring real-world scenarios of operator-dependent technologies and the barriers limiting POCUS's routine use for dengue screening.
